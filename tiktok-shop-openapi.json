Pass the returned brand ID when creating or editing a product to associate the brand with the product. - To check if a brand is fully authorized for use in a specific product category, specify the **category ID**. - To obtain the full list of brands that your shop can potentially use and their authorization status, omit the category ID. We recommend that you specify the **brand name** to narrow down the list of brands returned. **Key concept** Whether you can select and display a brand depends on the brand\\'s authorization status, the categories authorized for the brand, and whether the brand is classified as T1 (internationally renowned brands that require prior brand authorization). **- Brand selection rules**: You can only select the following types of brands during product creation/editing.    - Authorized brands which contain the desired category (`authorized_status=AUTHORIZED` and `brand_status=AVAILABLE`)    - Unauthorized non-T1 brands (`authorized_status=UNAUTHORIZED` and `is_t1_brand=false`)  **- Brand display rules**: Note however that brands will only appear on the product display page if the brand is authorized (`authorized_status=AUTHORIZED`) and available in the desired category (`brand_status=AVAILABLE`). This means that you need to obtain brand authorization for unauthorized non-T1 brands before they can be displayed. Obtain brand authorization or add categories to an authorized brand through TikTok Shop Seller Center > Qualification Center > Brand qualification. **For Tokopedia sellers**: You can select and display any returned brand on Tokopedia regardless of these rules.",

For other categories, contact your account manager for assistance. After product creation, use the [Publish Global Product API](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650a64d6defece02be678fd6) to publish and translate the product in the desired markets. **Key concept**: Global products are products created by cross-border sellers to be sold in shops outside of their base country. With global products, cross-border sellers operating across multiple markets can avoid creating the same product for each shop individually. Instead, they just need to create a single global product, which can be published and synced to all their shops, simplifying product management across markets. **Note**: - This API is applicable only for intra-EU sellers and global sellers. To create and list local products intended for sale exclusively in local shops, use the [Create Product API](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/6502fc8da57708028b42b18a) instead. - There may be a limit to the number of products you can list per day. We recommend prioritizing the creation of key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage. - The language used in the product content must align with the target market\\'s language (e.g. don\\'t use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.",

For example, if you have customized the local prices such as the local pre-tax price or the local display price, they will be overwritten each time this API is called. **Note**: - There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage. - All inputs, including blanks, in the request payload will overwrite existing values. To retain an existing value, make sure to include it in your request. Therefore, **it is strongly recommended to retrieve the latest product data using [Get Global Product](6509e2b0bace3e02b7490c96) and submit the complete data when editing**. This ensures accuracy and helps avoid errors or unintentional data loss due to missing fields. - The language used in the product content must align with the target market\\'s language (e.g. don\\'t use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.",

After editing the product, the latest product content (referred to as v2) will be resent for audit review. If the audit passes, v2 is published to the shop, otherwise, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1). However, edits to the `price` or `inventory` fields do not require a reaudit and will be immediately published on the platform. Use the [Product status change](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650956aff1fd3102b90b6261) webhook to keep track of the review status. **Note**:  - This API is applicable only for **active sellers/shops** that have completed the KYC onboarding process. - There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage. - All inputs, including blanks, in the request payload will overwrite existing values. To retain an existing value, make sure to include it in your request. Exceptions to this rule are the `price` and `inventory` fields, which will remain unchanged if they are omitted from the request. Therefore, **it is strongly recommended to retrieve the latest product data using [Get Product](6509d85b4a0bb702c057fdda) and submit the complete data when editing**. This ensures accuracy and helps avoid errors or unintentional data loss due to missing fields. - If you wish to edit only certain properties, you can use the [Partial Edit Product API](650a98d74a0bb702c06c3289), [Update Inventory API](6503068fc20ad60284b38858), or the [Update Price API](650307de5a12ff0294eac8b0). - The language used in the product content must align with the target market\\'s language (e.g. don\\'t use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected. **For global sellers**: If you\\'re using the local replication listing method, note the following sync rules: - To sync any changes to other markets, please provide the `seller_sku` and complete `replicated_products` data.  - Note that **category changes** and **sales attribute changes** (in sales attribute id/name) must be synced to other markets. The API call will fail if you don\\'t provide these details. **For Tokopedia sellers**: Note that a product can have **only one active version** across all platforms at any time. If a product is live on both platforms, audit results for the latest version are handled as follows: - **Mixed audit results**: If the product passes audit on one platform but fails on another, on the successful platform, the product will stay live and be updated with content from the latest version (v2), while on the failed platform, the product will be deactivated and hidden entirely. - **Audit failure on all platforms**: If the product fails audit on all platforms, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1).",

After editing the product, the latest product content (referred to as v2) will be resent for audit review. If the audit passes, v2 is published to the shop, otherwise, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1). However, edits to the `price` or `inventory` fields do not require a reaudit and will be immediately published on the platform. Use the [Product status change](650956aff1fd3102b90b6261) webhook to keep track of the review status. **Note**:  - This API is applicable for all sellers. - There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage. - If a draft or audit-review version exists, unedited fields will retain their values over those of the base (live) version. - **Updates are handled per top-level property**, so all non-empty fields within an updated object must be supplied to prevent overwriting with blanks. For top-level properties (e.g. `description`, `brand_id`) that are not nested in an object, you can update them individually. Omitting these properties in the request will leave them unchanged. If you need to edit any nested property within an object, you must provide values for all nested properties of that object. Any omitted nested properties will be overwritten with blanks. - If new mandatory product attributes were added by TikTok Shop after the creation of your product, ensure that you provide these attributes too. **For global sellers**: If you\\'re using the local replication listing method, note the following sync rules: **Sales attribute changes** (in sales attribute id/name) must be synced to other markets. Therefore, you must provide the `seller_sku` and complete `replicated_products` data. The API call will fail if you don\\'t provide these details. **New SKUs* (new sales attribute value id/name) are optional to sync to other markets. To sync, please provide the `seller_sku` and complete `replicated_products` data. **General changes** are optional to sync to other markets. To sync, you only need to provide `replicated_products.region`. **For Tokopedia sellers**: Note that a product can have **only one active version** across all platforms at any time. If a product is live on both platforms, audit results for the latest version are handled as follows: - **Mixed audit results**: If the product passes audit on one platform but fails on another, on the successful platform, the product will stay live and be updated with content from the latest version (v2), while on the failed platform, the product will be deactivated and hidden entirely. - **Audit failure on all platforms**: If the product fails audit on all platforms, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1).",
